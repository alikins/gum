gum is a tool to manage git repos. 

The intended useage is for a project to include
a gum.config that includes all git repos that fork
the project. 

Since the project can have many people working on
forks of the code, the tool is designed to make it
easier to keep track of those repos. 

The upstream maintainer can maintain the gum.config
file with the available repos (merging the configs
from forks as needed). 

Useage:

To see a list of other repos with this project ("remotes"
in git terms). 

	gum -l

To see a list of other branches in the other repos (remote branches
in git terms).

	gum -L

To add all of the remote repos and branches:
	
	gum -A
